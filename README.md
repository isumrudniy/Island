# JavaRush-Game_Island
JavaRush. Module 2.
### Task:
Develop a model of an island with variable parameters, consisting of an array of locations (e.g. 100x20 cells). The locations will be filled with vegetation and animals.

The animals can:
* eat plants and/or other animals (if there is suitable food in their location);
* move (to neighboring locations);
* reproduce (if there is a pair in their location);
* starve to death or be eaten.

### Note:
Implemented:
* animal Hierarchy (OOP);
* animal behavior;
* multithreading (schedule);
* statistics on island state at each cycle (in console).
